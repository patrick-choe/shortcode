## Outsider

Outsider can contribute by `Issues` and `Pull Request`.

If an Outsider worked hard, the Outsider can be a Insider.

Outsider Permissions - `Participate in a golfcoding project`, `Apply a language`, `Apply a module`, `Application for additional projects` etc.

## Insider

Insider could `Push` to do something.

### Add language
To add a language the Insider must enter the language name and version in the file `ALLOWED_LANGUAGE.txt`. (Example: `SansScript 1.0.0`)

### Add module
To add a module the Insider must check the content below and enter the module name and version in the file `ALLOWED_MODULES/{language name}.txt` (Example: `PingPongTool 1.0.0`)

#### Check
- Is the language in the file `ALLOWED_LANGUAGE.txt`?
- Isn't the module already applied?
- Isn't there a module that does an similar function?
- Is the module's function special? (Can be evaluated on a subjective basis)

### Add project
To add a project the Insider must create a folder. (Create folder => Add `README.md` => Enter description)

### Etc
To change a file the Insider should talk with other Insiders.

It is allowed to change the file without talking with other Insiders but if the file's content turn bad, the Insider may be punished.
